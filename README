Thread-Actor

Thread::Actor is a user friendly and object-oriented wrapper around L<threads::lite>. It was created because threads::lite has some powerful but confusing behavior, in particular around the start-up function. Thread::Actor is meant to be inherited from, though it also exports functions.
